# A WLM solution that ensures 100% device utilization and Process the WorkItems from different Queues based on the Process Priority & WorkItem Priority -  

This is a solution if you have Multiple Queues under the same Process and all these queues will be Utilizing the same devices (devicepool)

## Files :
* Python Script  - WLM_MaxDeviceUtility_PrioritySync_Solution.py
* Config.json
* runCronJob.bat

## CR Users :
* A user is required to execute the APIs in the Python script, and their credentials should be specified in the config file. 
  * Roles: AAE_Admin
  * License: None
## Instructions :
  * Pause all the Feeder Queue automations.
  * All the Feeder Queues and the Active Queue's automation will use the same Device Pool, which should include all the existing runner devices.
  * Process-specific device allocation can be mentioned in the config.json file
  * Add work items to the FeederQueues as usual. The Cron job will pick items from FeederQueues and push it to Active Queue based on Priority.
  * The actual WorkItem response tracking of workitems added to the FeederQueues will be available in the ActiveQueue “WorkItem Result” column.
  * The WorkItem template of ActiveQueue should be as follows:
    * Body
    * BotPath
  * Modify the existing FeederQueue Bots to retrieve input from a dictionary variable instead of the "Work Item" variable. The usage of the WorkItem Result variable remains unchanged.


 * You can debug the issues by using the log file generated by the Python script.  You can find the log file in Temp folder with name "WLM_Queue_Optimized.log"
