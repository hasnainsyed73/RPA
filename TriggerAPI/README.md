# Triggering an API without waiting for the response

The Code in this repo is to trigger an API and not wait for the response. In certain cases there is a need to just trigger the service and the backend takes too long to return the response, and in a scenario where we just want to trigger it and continue with our process, this SDK helps in doing so.
